## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the University of Pennsylvania libraries. I split my time there between the Information Desk at the main entrance and the Lippincott Library of the Whartson School of Business. This is how I gain hands-on library experience while I pursue my MLIS degree at Drexel University.
