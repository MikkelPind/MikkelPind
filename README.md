## Hi there 👋
A few things about me:
- 🔭 I work at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. I split my time there between the Information Desk at the main entrance and the Lippincott Library of the Wharton School of Business. This is how I gain hands-on library experience while I pursue my MLIS degree at Drexel University. 
- 🎓 I have just started the fourth of five quarters of said Drexel MLIS program, which means I will have my degree by the end of March. Soon, I will start applying for jobs in academic libraries and/or archives. I hope to be able to stay here in the Philadelphia area, but would be willing to relocate if the right job opportunity presents itself. 
- 👯 Not sure what these two dancers represent, but let's just assume that they are Showgirls, which is quite the coindience as I am presently listening to **The Life of a Showgirl**, which -- finally -- arrived on Saturday. (Yes, I am a **Swiftie**, too!).
- 🚵‍♂️ 🏍️ When I am not at work or studying, I like to ride my bike or my motorcycle.
- 👨🏻‍🍳 And to cook!
- 📫 How to reach me: mps367@drexel.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I created this profile because it was part of an assignment for my MLIS degree.
